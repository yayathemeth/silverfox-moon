## ✨ What is Silverfox - Moon?

This version (v5.1) tracks the **current Moon phase** and **Moon zodiac sign**, then:
- Generates a **custom AI-written emotional reflection** using GPT-3.5.
- Stores this reflection in a **MoonMemory database**, creating a living archive.
- Presents all data in a beautiful, responsive **frontend web interface**.

It’s a spiritual dashboard.
A poetic processor.
A soft breath of awareness through the stars.
